## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**FedSimSup** is a new federated learning framework designed for **personalized learning** under **local supervision**. It introduces:

- âœ… A **similarity-based aggregation strategy** that improves convergence by selectively aggregating model updates based on inter-client similarities;
- âœ… A **local supervisor module** that guides each client using local data statistics, enabling more tailored learning;
- âœ… A **parallel structure** that decouples general representation learning and personalization, improving scalability and performance.

This repository will include:
- Full PyTorch implementation of FedSimSup
- Experimental results on standard FL benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, FemNIST)
- Ablation studies and visualization scripts
